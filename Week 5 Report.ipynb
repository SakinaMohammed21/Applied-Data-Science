    "Lots of people are migrating to various states of Canada and needed lots of research for good housing prices and reputed schools for their children. This project is for those people who are looking for better neighborhoods. For ease of accessing cafe, school, supermarket, medical shops, grocery shops, mall, theatre, hospital, like-minded people, etc.\n",

    "This project aims to create an analysis of features for people migrating to Scarborough to search the best neighborhood as a comparative analysis between neighborhoods. The features include median housing price and better school according to ratings, crime rates of that particular area, road connectivity, weather conditions, good management for an emergency, water resources both fresh and wastewater, and excrement conveyed in sewers and recreational facilities.\n",

As such, the foursquare location platform was used as the sole data source since all the stated required information can be obtained through the API.\n",
